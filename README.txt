WarRunner README
Created by Erik Helm and William Blanchett, Nov. 2018. 

Requires Java (Written in Java 10 in IntelliJ IDEA). 


ABOUT: 
This is a program that simulates a war between created fighters. The fighter's stats can be determined or randomized. Fights are based upon both stats and randomness. 
Threads are implemented to simulate all fights between members of the army "simultaneously" 
Concurrency is implemented in recording a team score based upon the results of each fight. 


HOW TO USE: 

1. Run WarRunner.jar to start the program.

2. Select the "Fighters" screen to create fighters with stats. (These stats can be randomized)

3. Use Done to return to the Main screen

4. Select "Fight" to set up the war to be simulated. 

5. Select the Red Army fighers and the Blue Army fighters. 

6. Enter how many fighters are on each army. 

7. The war will be simulated and results displayed in a new window.

Note:  If a war is simulated between large armies, the GUI will appear to freeze. This is normal; just give the program time to run and finish.
