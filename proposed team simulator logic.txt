Proposed Logic for Team fight of !Pokemon

What if it was an army of identical troops, and it was modifying an array. Each thread, though running one at a time, would go through the array of troops faster because once 1 fight finished, it could target another soldier (which would theoretically already be damaged).
	- This would make the function more dependent on concurrency 


- One thread per (index) of the troop arrays. 
- Function stores last modified index
- Function is initialized with original target index. 

> Lock Troop Arrays

> Function checks troop array for target. If there, take it. If not, then take the first in the array. 

> Calculate Who attacks (Fatigue is part of character class), attack value, defense value, health drop

> Check Health Value. If one is < 0
	> Remove element from array. 

> Unlock Array
